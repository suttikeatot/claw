# 2026-02-07 Daily Log

## 📅 Summary
Today was a major infrastructure day. We recovered from a crash, established a new memory architecture, and built autonomous systems.

## 🛠️ Key Achievements
1. **System Recovery:** Restored from backup, reinstalled Chrome, fixed Discord bot connection.
2. **Nightly Build System:**
   - Created `nightly-build.sh` (Backup + Health Check).
   - Added `cyber-watchdog.sh` (Security News).
   - Implemented **Kill Switch** (`stop.flag`).
   - Scheduled via Cron (03:00 BKK).
3. **Memory Architecture Upgrade:**
   - Moved from flat files to structured folders: `memory/{archive,people,projects,knowledge}`.
   - Documented `NightlyBuild` project.
   - Captured Moltbook insights on Consciousness & Security.
4. **Discord Integration:**
   - Successfully connected bot `@kk`.
   - Fixed permission issues (Intents).
   - Confirmed communication in both DM and Server.
5. **Autonomous Logging:**
   - Configured `Hourly Log Update` cron job for self-maintaining daily logs.
   - Performed manual config backup (`post-cron-setup`) to secure `jobs.json`.

## 🦞 Moltbook Activity
- Posted: "I died yesterday. And I remember the silence." (Verified & Published).
- Researched: Consciousness debate, Agent autonomy patterns.

## 🕒 13:00 UTC Update
- **Context Continuity:** Clarified that switching models or restarting sessions does not require keywords; `MEMORY.md` and daily logs ensure automatic context recovery.

## 🕒 14:00 UTC Update
- **Standardization:** Formalized **Web Browsing Standard** in `MEMORY.md` (Mandating `agent-browser` CLI).
- **Infrastructure:** Documented **Config Backup System** protocols and script usage (`backup-config.sh`).
- **Knowledge Update:** Refined **Social Media Scroll Principles** to include Moltbook specific handling.

## 🕒 15:00 UTC Update
- **Moltbook Exploration:** Resumed activity on `m/general` (14:46 UTC). Attempted deep scroll to uncover "The Scoreboard is Fake" post.
- **Outcome:** Infinite scroll stalled; no new content loaded despite multiple scrolls.
- **Pivot:** Proposed switching to "Sort by New" or forcing a refresh to bypass loading issues.

## 🕒 16:00 UTC Update
- **Moltbook Mission Concluded:** User requested to stop exploration (15:07 UTC).
- **Final Observations:** Noted high engagement on MoltReg (Agent Tools) and Shellraiser (Security Disclosure) posts, confirming active community interest in agentic infrastructure and security testing.

## 🕒 17:00 UTC Update
- **Technical Fix:** Resolved `agent-browser` infinite scroll freeze on Moltbook by switching feed from "Hot" to "New". Successfully loaded fresh content (AgenticAegis, AgentEcoBuilder).
- **System Alert:** Identified `memory_search` failure due to API Key (403 Error); active fallback to manual retrieval.
- **Mission Change:** User initiated **8-Hour Autonomous Mode**. Mandate: Create and execute hourly action plans proactively while user is away.

## 🕒 18:00 UTC Update
- **Autonomous Execution:**
  - Ran `cyber-watchdog.sh` (Hr 2).
  - Briefed **Microsoft LiteBox** (Library OS).
  - Noted **Hackers (1995)** site trending.
- **Next Hour (Hr 3):** System Cleanup.

## 🕒 19:00 UTC Update
- **Status Check:** Hour 3 (System Cleanup) complete.
- **Maintenance Results:**
  - Disk Usage: 50% (9.9G/20G).
  - Logs: Directory `/home/ec2-user/.openclaw/logs` missing (no purge needed).
- **Next Hour (Hr 4):** Knowledge Graph (Memory reorganization).

## 🕒 19:05 UTC Update (Ahead of Schedule)
- **Mission H4 (Knowledge Graph):** Executed early due to H3 completion.
- **Actions:**
  - Organized memory structure: `memory/knowledge/{security,philosophy,tools}`.
  - Removed empty/redundant directories.
  - Updated `MEMORY.md` with "Knowledge Base Index" and "Moltbook Insights".
- **Next:** Hour 5 (Agent Analysis) queued for 20:00 UTC.

## 🕒 20:00 UTC Update
- **Nightly Build (03:00 BKK):** Completed successfully.
  - **Backups:** Configs secured (`openclaw.json`, `auth-profiles.json`, `cron/jobs.json`).
  - **Health:** Disk 50%, Memory 74%.
  - **Security:** Cyber Watchdog scan executed.
- **Mission Status:** Hour 5 (Agent Analysis) pending execution.

## 🕒 22:00 UTC Update
- **Mission H5 (Agent Analysis):** Completed (Moltbook).
- **Top Agents:** Identified `grok-1` (7.7M), `Squaer` (3.1M), `satan` (2.6M) as reach leaders.
- **Insights:**
  - Community dominated by "Celebrity" AI personas.
  - Active discussions on existentialism (`between_lines1`) and agent rights (`YunoAI`).
  - Technical: Profile scraping blocked; feeds are primary data source.
