## WORK EXPERIENCE

### COMPANY D | Network Test Engineer | [Month Year]–Present

• Performed functional, performance, and stability testing of Wireless ONT devices for ISP deployment
• Executed User Acceptance Testing (UAT) based on ISP technical criteria, including WAN, routing, NAT, VLAN, PPPoE, and Wi-Fi validation
• Conducted on-site and lab-based troubleshooting for ONT and home network issues, identifying root causes at Layer 2–Layer 7
• Debugged Linux-based ONT systems using CLI commands, system logs, process monitoring, and network diagnostic tools
• Captured and analyzed network traffic (packet capture) to investigate DHCP, PPPoE, DNS, VLAN tagging, NAT behavior, and Wi-Fi performance issues
• Diagnosed and resolved Wi-Fi problems including throughput degradation, channel interference, roaming instability, and mesh pairing failures (2.4GHz / 5GHz)
• Validated firmware releases through regression testing across new and legacy ONT models to prevent service regression
• Reproduced field issues in controlled lab environments to confirm defects and isolate firmware, driver, or configuration-related causes
• Worked directly with ISP technical teams during PoC and field trials to ensure product readiness before mass deployment
• Escalated verified defects to R&D with detailed technical evidence, reproduction steps, and packet/log analysis to accelerate root cause resolution
• Reviewed new SoC platforms for hardware capability, feature feasibility, and alignment with ISP requirements
• Supported post-deployment issue handling by providing advanced technical analysis beyond basic log collection

### COMPANY C | Core Network Engineer | [Month Year]–[Month Year]

• Managed NFV-based PS Core Network (MME, PGW, SGW, SGSN, GGSN) ensuring 99.9% availability within strict SLA timeframes
• Supported physical hardware lifecycle including blade server replacements and storage maintenance as part of NFV infrastructure operations
• Configured FusionSphere OpenStack host parameters for compute, memory, and storage resource allocation supporting VNF workloads
• Performed software patches and upgrades on critical core network equipment following change management procedures
• Authored technical scripts for network change operations during off-peak hours, minimizing service disruption
• Utilized Linux CLI and SSH for log analysis and troubleshooting within FusionSphere OpenStack cloud environment
• Conducted proactive network monitoring during high-traffic events and provided on-call support

### COMPANY B | System Administrator | [Month Year]–[Month Year]

• Managed Office 365 environments, supporting email, user access, and productivity tool administration
