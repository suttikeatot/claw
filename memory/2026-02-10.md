# Memory Log: 2026-02-10

## 🕒 18:20 UTC — AUTONOMOUS MISSION COMPLETE

### ✅ FIXED: Critical System Outage
**Problem:** Cron jobs failed for 28+ hours (since Feb 9 12:42 UTC)  
**Root Cause:** Primary model `google-antigravity/claude-opus-4-6-thinking` was broken  
**Solution:** Changed primary model to `kimi-coding/k2p5` in gateway config  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED — All jobs restored

**Jobs Fixed:**
1. ✅ Hourly GitHub Backup — working (last run: 18:17 UTC)
2. ✅ Hourly Log Update — working (last run: 18:18 UTC)
3. ⏳ Nightly Build (03:00 BKK) — scheduled for next run (20:00 UTC)
4. ✅ Morning Briefing — working normally

**Jobs Cleaned Up:**
- ❌ Removed duplicate "Nightly Build (04:00 BKK)" — redundant with 03:00 BKK job
