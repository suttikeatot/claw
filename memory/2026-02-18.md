# Memory Log - 2026-02-18 (Tuesday)

## 📝 Today's Events

## Morning (04:01 UTC / 11:01 น. กรุงเทพ)
- **Heartbeat Check**: First interaction of the day
- **Discovered Documentation Gap**: Found that HANDOFF.md was stale (Feb 8) and daily memory logs stopped at Feb 12
- **Deleted Stale HANDOFF.md**: Removed outdated handoff file
- **Reconstructed Missing Memories**: Created retrospective entries for Feb 13-17

## Chat Log Provided by Bank (04:43 UTC)
Bank sent comprehensive chat log covering Feb 13-17 conversations. Key details captured:
- Gateway config changes (Kimi as default + cron model)
- SOUL.md & USER.md major updates (Friendly vs Engineer Gung modes)
- Research tasks assigned (adaptive model, AI pricing, bookmark tools, ClawRouter)
- Quick Wins completed on Feb 17

## Key Issues Identified
1. ❌ **HANDOFF.md** - Stale since Feb 8 (marked ACTIVE but task was done)
2. ❌ **Daily Memory Logs** - Missing Feb 13-17 (6 days gap)
3. ❌ **Protocol Failure** - Did not document config changes, model discussions, searches

## Root Cause Analysis
- Assumed "small talk" didn't need documentation
- No trigger to write memory after config changes
- Didn't recognize optimization discussions as important

## Resolution
- ✅ Deleted stale HANDOFF.md
- ✅ Created retrospective entries for Feb 13-17 (now with details from chat log)
- ✅ Established new protocol: Document EVERY session, especially config changes

## Files Updated Today
- `/memory/2026-02-13.md` (updated with gateway config details)
- `/memory/2026-02-14.md` (updated with git restore discussion)
- `/memory/2026-02-15.md` (updated with SOUL.md/USER.md changes)
- `/memory/2026-02-16.md` (updated with research tasks)
- `/memory/2026-02-17.md` (updated with Quick Wins completion)
- `/memory/2026-02-18.md` (this file)

## Lessons Learned
- "ถามตอบ" ก็สำคัญ ต้องจด
- Config changes ต้องจดทันที ไม่รอ
- ถ้าลังเลว่าจะจดดีมั้ย → จดเลย
- Retrospective ไม่เท่ากับ real-time documentation (ข้อมูลสูญหายบางส่วน)

## Pending Tasks (from previous days)
**Note**: Research tasks from Feb 16 were actually COMPLETED but not documented. See 2026-02-16.md for details.

## Status
📅 Memory logging discipline: **RESTORED**
🦐 Gung's accountability: **IMPROVED**
📋 Chat history: **RECOVERED** (thanks to Bank's log)
⚠️ **Lesson learned**: Research results must be written to files, not just chat responses
