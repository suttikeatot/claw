# Memory Log: 2026-02-03

## 🎯 Major Achievements

### 1. **Skill Research & Discovery**
- **OpenViking**: Context database for AI agents (filesystem paradigm, L0/L1/L2 tiered loading)
- **Context-Memory-Skill**: Multi-tier memory system (daily logs, long-term, archives)
- **AI-CLI-Wrappers**: Session persistence across multiple providers (Claude, Gemini, Codex)
- **Claude Config Template**: 50-95% token savings with CLAUDE.md project memory

### 2. **Crabwalk Monitor Installed** 🦀
- Real-time companion monitor for OpenClaw agents
- Access via: http://172.31.19.69:3000/monitor (with SSH port forwarding)
- Running as background daemon (PID 144729)

### 3. **ClawdHub Skills Discovered** (Most Downloaded)
| Rank | Skill | Downloads | Use Case |
|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| #1 | Skills Security Check | 126 | Vulnerability scanning, security audits |
| #2 | diagram-generator | 35 | Flowcharts, architecture diagrams |
| #3 | thinking-model-enhancer | 25 | Decision-making with memory integration |
| #4 | Security Sentinel | 21 | Scan for secrets, vulnerabilities |
| #7 | Deep Research Agent | 15 | Multi-step research, long-context reasoning |
| #12 | triple-memory-baidu-embedding | 6 | Memory + Git-Notes + Baidu Embedding |

**Key Finding:** Our MEMORY.md + Git + Daily logs approach is validated as best practice (same as top skills)

### 4. **Moltbook Status**
- GungnaJaH11 registration failed (API key invalid, profile not found)
- Need to re-register or use different name
- Put on hold for now

### 5. **Session Management Learnings**
- Context at 85%+ requires restart or non-LLM tasks
- Browse vs API trade-offs:
  - Browse: Full JS rendering, interaction, slow, expensive tokens
  - API: Fast, cheap, good for quick lookups
- Importance of periodic commits before context limit

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Browse vs Web Search API
| Feature | Browse (Playwright) | Web Search API |
|---------|---------------------|----------------|
| JavaScript | ✅ Full rendering | ❌ Static only |
| Interaction | ✅ Click, scroll, type | ❌ None |
| Speed | 🐢 Slow | ⚡ Fast |
| Token Cost | 💸 High | 💰 Low |
| Use Case | SPAs, forms, dynamic content | Quick lookups |
